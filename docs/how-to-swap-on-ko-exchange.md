### Swap Chain

Make sure the current chain in wallet and source chain are the same. If not, it will show "Switch to the correct chain", please press and confirm.

1.  Swap between ETH based chains (BSC Testnet, Fantom Testnet, Polygon Testnet, Avalanche Tesnet)

Please enter a valid amount and press the "Swap" button

We provide links to your transaction after it succeeds.

In the source chain, the transaction hash will be available immediately so the link will take you to the transaction link.

But transaction hash in the destination chain will be available after a while, so the link will take you to the page that lists the token transfers.

Please wait and pay attention to the new "IN" row.

Or you can check token balance in [https://app.ko.exchange/wallet](https://app.ko.exchange/wallet)

2.  Swap between ETH based chain and Cardano testnet

Like swap between ETH based chains, but you should provide your recipient address which will receive a token (address format must be valid in the destination chain).

**Hint:** In Cardano chain, you can see the token balance, transaction in, transaction out in your wallet (such as Nami) a bit faster than cardano explorer.
