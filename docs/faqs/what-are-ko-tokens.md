title: What are KO Tokens?
---

KO Tokens are a tool enabling cross-chain composability. It is an essential component enabling Decentralized Financial (DeFi) DApps to be compatible with any crypto asset.

Each blockchain is confined to its own technological boundaries. As a direct consequence, liquidity is locked within its ecosystem. Liquidity is largely spread across a large number of blockchain platforms and difficult to merge into a single pool. For this reason, it becomes essential to create solutions that allow effective cross-chain composability for DApps to access any asset. KO Tokens enable cross-chain composability effectively. They are an essential component for DeFi DApps to be compatible with any crypto asset and for liquidity to move seamlessly from one blockchain to another.
