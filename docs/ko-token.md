## KO Token

The $KO token is the heart of our KO exchange ecosystem; it was built on the Ethereum compatible blockchains with a smart code that makes it safe to invest and beneficial to hold.

There will be a maximum 10,000,000 KO tokens in circulation. The token can be used to reward liquidity providers, governance voting.

Earn governance rights and 0.05% of all swaps from all chains in one simple place.

0.05% of every transaction is deducted and redistributed to our pool of holders. It means that just by holding it you will see the number of tokens increasing automatically everyday as the community transacts.

## KO Liquidity provider

To be a liquidity provider, holders of any token need to supply equal parts liquidity for that token, and a second token (usually a stable coin). In return, these holders receive KOSwap liquidity provider tokens that represent their share of the pooled liquidity for that token pair. The existence of this pooled liquidity gives other traders access to the underlying tokens in exchange for a small fee, which is distributed proportionately to all the liquidity providers.

To receive KO rewards, users should deposit the token received for providing liquidity. These rewards help bring new coins to the market, and new coins feed the trading volume on KOSwap. Trading volume in turn increases the value of KO tokens.

Tokens are chosen to be on the KOSwap based on the quality and demand of their products.

- Build on KOSwap - skip this for now
- Expanding KO cross chain ecosystem with Sisu

In the future, KO Exchange will partner with Sisu Network as part of our cross-chain network ecosystem. KO holders will be able to swap cross chain seamlessly and support private transactions.

Sisu network is a decentralized, trustless layer that connects and facilitates seamless transactions between various blockchains. Sisu can support any L1, L2 or sidechain transactions whether it is a token swapping request or smart contract function call.
